# FoodSearch

This is a simple project to test neural networks with the LambdaNet library. The given problem is to find food in a small simple world.

There are three modules: Base contains the types and basic algorithm, Neural is neural network code and Pretty a pretty printer to visualize the algorithm's progress.

There is also a Main module that show a simple example and a test suite that can give you insights on how the code works.
